## Solution Overview:

### Data Ingestion:
To handle diverse data formats (JSON, CSV, Avro) and high data volumes, a distributed streaming data processing framework like Apache Kafka can be employed. Kafka Connect can be used for seamless integration with various data sources, ensuring reliability and scalability. Additionally, Apache NiFi can be utilized for data ingestion and routing, offering easy-to-use UI for designing data flows.

### Data Processing:
Apache Spark can be employed for data transformation tasks, allowing parallel processing and scalability. Spark Streaming can process real-time data streams, while batch processing can handle historical data. Data validation, filtering, and deduplication can be implemented using Spark's rich set of APIs. Correlating ad impressions with clicks and conversions can be achieved through join operations based on common keys like user IDs and timestamps.

### Data Storage and Query Performance:
For efficient storage and fast querying, a combination of Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and Apache Hive can be utilized. HDFS provides scalable, fault-tolerant storage for large datasets, while Hive offers a SQL-like interface for querying data stored in Hadoop. Partitioning and indexing can be employed in Hive to optimize query performance, especially for ad campaign analysis involving aggregations.

### Error Handling and Monitoring:
Apache Kafka's built-in monitoring features can be leveraged for real-time monitoring of data ingestion pipelines. Tools like Apache ZooKeeper can be used for distributed coordination and management. Additionally, a custom monitoring dashboard can be developed using tools like Grafana and Prometheus to visualize key metrics and detect anomalies. Alerting mechanisms can be implemented using tools like Apache Airflow or custom scripts integrated with email or Slack notifications.
